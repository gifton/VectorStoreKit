/// by using completion handlers instead of blocking operations.

/// ```swift
/// let commandQueue = MetalCommandQueue(device: device)
/// 
/// try await commandQueue.submitAsync { buffer in
///     // Encode your Metal operations
///     let encoder = buffer.makeBlitCommandEncoder()!
///     encoder.copy(from: sourceBuffer, to: destBuffer)
///     encoder.endEncoding()
/// }
/// ```
