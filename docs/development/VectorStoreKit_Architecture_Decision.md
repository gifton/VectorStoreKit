# VectorStoreKit Architecture Decision Document

## Executive Summary

This document presents three architectural approaches for VectorStoreKit, a high-performance on-device vector database for Apple platforms. We need to decide between:

1. **Unified Index Architecture**: A "smart database" with automatic optimization
2. **Composable Modules Architecture**: A toolkit of specialized components  
3. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**: A hybrid approach combining both benefits

**Recommendation**: Adopt the Progressive Disclosure Architecture, starting with a unified API while building on modular internals for future extensibility.

## Context and Requirements

### Project Goals
- Provide fast, efficient vector similarity search on Apple devices
- Integrate seamlessly with EmbedKit and PipelineKit
- Support datasets from 1K to 10M+ vectors
- Maintain privacy with on-device processing
- Enable both simple and advanced use cases

### Target Users
1. **Primary (80%)**: iOS developers adding AI features
2. **Secondary (15%)**: Experienced developers with specific performance needs
3. **Tertiary (5%)**: ML engineers requiring custom implementations

## Architectural Approaches

### Approach 1: Unified Index Architecture

**Philosophy**: Single, intelligent system that handles all complexity internally.

```swift
// Simple API - everything automatic
let store = UnifiedVectorStore<Float32x16, Metadata>()
await store.add(vectors)
let results = await store.search(query, k: 10)
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatic index selection based on dataset size
- Transparent tier management (hot/warm/cold)
- Built-in optimization and compaction
- Single persistence format

**Pros**:
- ✅ Extremely simple to use
- ✅ No configuration needed
- ✅ Consistent performance
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Holistic optimizations possible

**Cons**:
- ❌ Limited flexibility
- ❌ Black box behavior
- ❌ Harder to debug issues
- ❌ One-size-fits-all approach
- ❌ Difficult to add custom algorithms

---

### Approach 2: Composable Modules Architecture

**Philosophy**: Provide building blocks that developers assemble based on needs.

```swift
// Flexible composition
let store = VectorStoreBuilder()
    .withIndex(HNSWIndex(m: 32))
    .withStorage(SQLiteStorage())
    .withQuantizer(ProductQuantizer())
    .build()
```

**Key Features**:
- Separate index implementations (HNSW, IVF, LSH, etc.)
- Pluggable storage backends
- Composable middleware system
- Mix-and-match components

**Pros**:
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ Clear component boundaries
- ✅ Easy to extend
- ✅ Testable in isolation
- ✅ Only pay for what you use

**Cons**:
- ❌ Steep learning curve
- ❌ Configuration complexity
- ❌ Integration overhead
- ❌ Harder to optimize globally
- ❌ More maintenance surface

---

### Approach 3: Progressive Disclosure Architecture (Recommended)

**Philosophy**: Simple by default, powerful when needed.

```swift
// Level 1: Automatic (80% of users)
let store = VectorStore()

// Level 2: Guided configuration (15% of users)
let store = VectorStore(configuration: .highPerformance)

// Level 3: Full control (5% of users)
let store = VectorStore(
    custom: VectorStoreBuilder()
        .withIndex(CustomIndex())
        .build()
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Three levels of API complexity
- Automatic mode with smart defaults
- Advanced configuration for common scenarios
- Full composability as escape hatch
- Built on modular internals

**Pros**:
- ✅ Easy onboarding
- ✅ Grows with user needs
- ✅ Best of both approaches
- ✅ Maintain simplicity
- ✅ Future flexibility

**Cons**:
- ❌ More design complexity
- ❌ Multiple API surfaces
- ❌ Documentation overhead

1. Build core protocols and types
2. Implement basic in-memory HNSW index
3. Create simple unified API
4. Add basic persistence (WAL + snapshots)
5. Integration with PipelineKit commands

**Deliverable**: Working vector store with automatic mode

### Phase 2: Modular Internals (Weeks 4-6)
1. Refactor to internal modular architecture
2. Add IVF index implementation
3. Implement tier management system
4. Create storage abstraction layer
5. Add comprehensive test suite

2. Add quantization support
3. Implement Metal acceleration
4. Create performance benchmarks
5. Document configuration options

**Deliverable**: System with advanced configuration options

### Phase 4: Full Composability (Weeks 9-10)

## Technical Decision Points

### Critical Questions for Discussion

1. **Index Algorithm Priority**
   - Start with HNSW only?
   - Include IVF from the beginning?
   - How important is LSH support?

2. **Storage Backend**
   - SQLite vs custom format?
   - Memory-mapped files from day one?
   - CloudKit sync support priority?

3. **API Design**
   - Async/await throughout?
   - How much PipelineKit integration?
   - Error handling strategy?

4. **Performance Targets**
   - Acceptable latency for different scales?
   - Memory budget constraints?
   - Startup time requirements?

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Risk**: Build benchmarks early, test on real devices
2. **API Lock-in**: Keep public API minimal initially
3. **Complexity Risk**: Start simple, add features based on feedback
4. **Integration Risk**: Coordinate closely with EmbedKit/PipelineKit teams

---

## Recommendation Summary

**Adopt the Progressive Disclosure Architecture** because it:

1. Provides the simplicity needed for rapid adoption
2. Maintains flexibility for advanced use cases
3. Allows incremental development and learning
4. Builds on modular internals for future growth
5. Balances all stakeholder needs effectively

The key insight is that we can have both simplicity AND power by layering our API design while maintaining a modular internal architecture.
