# Swift 6 Migration Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan systematically migrates VectorStoreKit to strict Swift 6 concurrency compliance by addressing critical issues in order of severity and dependency.

- [ ] Fix MPS integration patterns

## Phase 6: Test Suite Updates (Priority: Medium)

### 6.1 Test Isolation
- [ ] Add @MainActor to test classes where needed
- [ ] Fix shared test state issues
- [ ] Update mock objects for Sendable conformance
- [ ] Implement proper test cleanup

### 6.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Replace Date() with ContinuousClock
- [ ] Add proper async test patterns
- [ ] Implement memory management in tests
- [ ] Fix timing measurement accuracy

## Implementation Strategy

### Order of Execution:
1. **Foundation Types** - Ensure all basic types are Sendable
2. **Actor Boundaries** - Fix critical actor isolation issues
3. **Storage Safety** - Address data persistence concurrency
4. **Index Safety** - Fix graph operation race conditions
5. **GPU Resources** - Secure Metal resource management
6. **Test Validation** - Ensure all tests pass with strict concurrency

### Validation Steps:
- Run `swift build` after each phase
- Enable strict concurrency checking
- Run full test suite after each major change
- Performance regression testing

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All code compiles with Swift 6 strict concurrency
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No data race warnings
- [ ] Performance within 5% of baseline
- [ ] Memory usage stable under concurrent load
